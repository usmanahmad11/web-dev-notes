# Web Development - Introduction and First Steps

Welcome to the world of web development! In this first lecture, we will set up the tools you need and create your very first web page.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Tools

1. **Install a Code Editor**
   - Download and install [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
   - VS Code is a free, powerful, and beginner-friendly code editor.

2. **Install a Web Browser**
   - Download and install the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).
   - These browsers have excellent developer tools to help you debug and test your web pages.

3. **Set Up a Folder for Your Project**
   - Create a folder on your computer where you will store all your web development projects. For example: `WebDevProjects`.

4. **Install Live Server Extension for VS Code**
   - Open VS Code.
   - Go to the Extensions Marketplace (click the Extensions icon on the sidebar or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` on Windows / `Cmd+Shift+X` on Mac).
   - Search for "Live Server" and install it.
   - This extension allows you to view your web pages live in your browser as you edit them.

## Step 2: Create Your First Web Page

1. **Create a New HTML File**
   - Open the folder you created in VS Code.
   - Create a new file inside the folder and name it `index.html`.

2. **Write Basic HTML Code**
   - Open `index.html` and write the following code:

     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html lang="en">
     <head>
         <meta charset="UTF-8">
         <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
         <title>My First Web Page</title>
     </head>
     <body>
         <h1>Welcome to Web Development!</h1>
         <p>This is my very first web page.</p>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```

3. **Launch the Web Page**
   - Right-click on the `index.html` file in VS Code.
   - Select "Open with Live Server."
   - Your default browser will open, showing your first web page.

## Step 3: Explore and Experiment

1. **Edit the Page**
   - Try changing the text inside the `<h1>` and `<p>` tags.
   - Save the file and see the changes live in your browser.

2. **Add More Content**
   - Add another `<h2>` tag or a list using `<ul>` and `<li>` tags. For example:

     ```html
     <h2>My Interests</h2>
     <ul>
         <li>Coding</li>
         <li>Design</li>
         <li>Learning</li>
     </ul>
     ```

3. **Inspect the Page**
   - Right-click on the web page in your browser.
   - Select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element" to open the browser's developer tools.
   - Explore the elements and styles of your page.
